Everyone has their Character in a beautiful Matrix made of 2,136 [Jouyou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji) and 4 [Hyougai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hy%C5%8Dgai_kanji) kanji, with their own vibrant traits.

* **Rarity**. Corresponds to the school grade the kanji is taught in: **1–6** for primary school kanji (1,026 tokens), **S** for secondary school kanji (1,110 tokens). **H** for Hyougai is the highest rarity so far (4 tokens). Rarity is shown by the color of strokes.
* **Complexity**. Equals to the kanji stroke count with a median of 20.
* **Sentiment**. Has been assigned to each kanji individually based on the combined sentiment of its common meanings, from a set of six [original Ekman’s basic emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion#Basic_emotions): **Happy**, **Sad**, **Anger**, **Fear**, **Surprise**, and **Disgust**. They are apportioned approximately as 4:2:2:2:1:1. Around three fourths of tokens have neutral Sentiment. Tokens with different Sentiment have different background colors.
