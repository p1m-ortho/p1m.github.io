## Summary

Everyone has their Character in a beautiful Matrix made of 2,136 [Jouyou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji) and certain [Hyougai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hy%C5%8Dgai_kanji) kanji, with their own vibrant traits. At present, only unique, immutable **Genesis Collection** NFTs will be available. A link to purchase will be available soon.

## Traits

**Rarity**. This corresponds to the school year the kanji is taught in: **1â€“6** for primary school kanji (1,026 unique **Genesis Collection** tokens); **S** for secondary school kanji (1,110 **Genesis Collection** tokens). **H** for Hyougai is the highest **Rarity** so far (4 **Genesis Collection** tokens). **Rarity** is shown by the color of strokes.

**Complexity**. This equals to the kanji stroke count. Median **Complexity** is 20.

Data for both **Rarity** and **Complexity** were [downloaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_j%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji) from the English Wikipedia on June 9, 2022. Subsequently, they were deduplicated and refined with the assistance of [ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes).

**Sentiment**. This has been assigned to each of the kanji individually based on the combined subjective sentiment of its common meanings, from a set of [six basic emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion#Basic_emotions): **Happy**, **Sad**, **Anger**, **Fear**, **Surprise**, and **Disgust**. They are apportioned approximately as 4:2:2:2:1:1. Around three fourths of the tokens have **Neutral** **Sentiment**. Tokens with different **Sentiment** have different background colors.

**Popularity** is based on raw character occurence counts from the Japanese Wikipedia as [published](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scriptin/kanji-frequency/7022fa929a7d58d33ee281e285ca9c94342faa0c/data/wikipedia_characters.csv) by Dmitry Shpika. **Popularity** varies from zero to 1.7M occurences, with a median of 8K occurences.
